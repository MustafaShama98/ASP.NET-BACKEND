# New Zealand Regions and Walks API

Created a highly engaging Web API to define and manage the regions and walks of New Zealand. The goal is to develop an **ASP.NET Core Web API** that allows clients to consume this data through various endpoints.

## Learning Outcomes

### 1. **Understand REST APIs**
   - Learn how to create a Web API using **ASP.NET Core** and **.NET 8**.

### 2. **REST Principles**
   - Gain a clear understanding of **REST** principles such as:
     - Statelessness
     - Resource-based communication
     - HTTP methods

### 3. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
   - Learn the fundamentals of **Dependency Injection** (DI) and its benefits in **ASP.NET Core** applications.

### 4. **ASP.NET Core Web API Project Setup**
   - Learn how to create a new **ASP.NET Core Web API** project and structure it effectively.

### 5. **Transition to .NET 8**
   - Explore the new features and improvements in **.NET 8** and apply them to your Web API project.

### 6. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**
   - Understand how to install and use **EF Core** for database interaction in your Web API project.

### 7. **Entity Framework Core Migrations**
   - Learn how to use **EF Core Migrations** to manage database schema changes.

### 8. **Domain Models vs DTOs**
   - Understand the difference between **Domain Models** and **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** and how to use them effectively.

### 9. **Repository Pattern**
   - Implement the **Repository Pattern** to abstract data access and enhance code maintainability.

### 10. **Swagger for API Testing**
   - Use **Swagger** to test and document your **ASP.NET Core Web API** project.

### 11. **AutoMapper**
   - Learn how to map between models using **AutoMapper** to simplify model transformations.

### 12. **Asynchronous Programming**
   - Master **Async/Await** to implement asynchronous programming in your Web API.

### 13. **API Validation**
   - Implement validation mechanisms to ensure the correctness of data and API inputs.

### 14. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Secure your Web API using **Microsoft Identity**, adding **JWT Authentication** and **Role-Based Authorization**.

### 15. **JWT Tokens**
   - Learn how to add **JWT Authentication** to your API, allowing clients to authenticate using **JWT tokens**.

### 16. **Postman Testing**
   - Create **Read** and **Write** users and test authentication and authorization through **Postman**.

### 17. **JWT Integration with Swagger UI**
   - Integrate **JWT Authentication** into **Swagger UI** for easy testing of authenticated endpoints.

### 18. **Advanced API Features**
   - Add **Filtering**, **Sorting**, and **Pagination** functionality to your Web API to enhance its usability and performance.
